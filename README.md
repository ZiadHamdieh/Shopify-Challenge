# ShopifyChallenge

### Cocoapods used

1. SDWebImage


### Retrospective

With more time at hand, this is what I could have done better:

1. I had initially over-designed the network layer, which led to spending time on something that I ultimately scrapped.

2. Dealing with portrait/landscape mode turned out more challenging than I had initially imagined, possible because (I believe) of the dequeuing of cells that had already been matched or uncovered. In hindsight, I should have devoted a higher percentage of my time on smoothing out this part of the challenge.

3. I wasn't sure about the metrics @. In order to keep the ball rolling, I decided to create a dummy array holding the colors of each product. I definitely think I could have done better under this aspect.
